This project is a quick script that I can use to calculate how much each person should pay for our squad outing. It is nice to do in a python script because it allows me to easily adjust for different amounts of people making it.
By adjusting the variables at the top of the program, you can easily change the output to account for the 
different events (for example, whether or not you want the plebes to pay).
